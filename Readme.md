# Intercepting a Rocket using a Genetic Algorithm with Octave - Applied Computer Science II Final Project.
Project guided by Fernando Cervantes SÃ¡nchez, teacher of the course at CIMAT during June 2019.
## Objective
Obtain the trajectory of a Rocket based on a set of "images" (data files) taken by three different satellites that have different angles and use that information to predict the rocket's future trajectory and then use a genetic algorithm to intercept the rocket with another rocket.
## How to use
Set the directory as current working directory in Octave and then run the file _Proyecto3.m_.  At the beginning of that file, there are several variables that affect what the program does. The program currently only supports fixed values for the original rocket's launching parameters and the second rocket's launch site location although it is possible to configure the number of cycles that the genetic algorithm does as well as the size of each population. The comments inside the file explain how to modify these parameters.
